OSAC (Open Source ASCOL Circle) is a group of lerners based primarily on Computer Science and Information Technologies students from Amrit Science College, Tribhuvan University, Nepal.

### What we do?
We share our knowledge among friends through formal and informal, regular and occasional get-togethers. In such get-togethers we talk, demonstrate, teach share and learn BUT basically we have fun there.
