OSAC successfully conducted its first event for August as part of OSAC Week - the "Figma and Photoshop Workshop - Online Design Bootcamp". This event marked the beginning of our initiative to host monthly 2-5 day bootcamps, workshops, or webinars on specific tech topics.

The bootcamp covered both theoretical aspects of designing and practical applications. Our talented speaker, Nikki Arts (@nikki_arts__), led an engaging hands-on session, while Anupama Rai (@anupamaa_raii) skillfully moderated the event.

This Design Bootcamp sets the stage for upcoming graphics designing competitions exclusively for Amrit Science Campus students, providing them with an opportunity to apply their newly acquired skills.

We thank all participants for their enthusiasm and look forward to the next events in our OSAC Week series.
