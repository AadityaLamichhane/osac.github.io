An event must have interested participants to be called successful and we couldn't be more proud to have more than 50 participants in our event "Web development bootcamp using Leaflet Library".

It was also an orientation to our amazing juniors about our club and their active participation have encouraged us to push our limits in future. Hence, we gladly announce the successful completion of 2-days event amongst the 3 days and hope to have the same numbers tomorrow on virtual session as well.

Project demo of WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP will be at discord online @2:30PM, 04 March. Join OSAC's discord server with this link: https://discord.gg/2PdddsvaeZ

We would like to thank Open Mapping Hub - Asia Pacific for supporting us.
